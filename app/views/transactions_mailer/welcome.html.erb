<h1>Welcome to RunwayHorse, <%= @user.first_name %>!</h1>

<p>
  I made RunwayHorse because I wanted a better way to see what I was doing on my trip. The Google Docs, Sheets, and phone notes felt cumbersome and unwieldy â€” like a hack more than a solution. And most of the travel software out there did too much. It wanted to control where I went, what I did, and where I stayed. It annoyed me with its "partner" flights, hotels, and cars. It also made no sense to pay X dollars per month for something I didn't use while I wasn't traveling.

  I hope RunwayHorse eases some of your frustrations with travel planning. If you have any comments or questions, respond to this email or write to me at <a href="mailto:hello@runwayhorse.com">hello@runwayhorse.com</a>.
