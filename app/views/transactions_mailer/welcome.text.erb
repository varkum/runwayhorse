Welcome to RunwayHorse, <%= @user.first_name %>!

I made RunwayHorse because I wanted a better way to see what I was doing on my trip. The Google Docs/Sheets and phone notes everyone uses felt cumbersome and unwieldy, a hack more than a solution. And most of the travel software out there did too much. It wanted to control where I went, what I did, and where I stayed. It annoyed me with its associate flights, hotels, and cars that it tried to sell. It also made no sense to pay X dollars a month for something I didn't use at home.
	

I hope RunwayHorse eases some of your frustrations with travel planning. If you have any comments or questions, respond to this email or write to me at hello@runwayhorse.com.
